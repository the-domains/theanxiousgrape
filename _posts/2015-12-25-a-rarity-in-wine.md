Most wines never achieve this designation. To be characterized as palatable and satisfying typically takes months, if not years of aging. Once there, the festive and other youthful properties have long since surrendered to a new flavour equilibrium. Prominent and lingering flavours of maturity, such as spice, floral, acid, tannin or earthy notes have emerged -- qualities winemakers strive for, but no longer a vino giovane by definition.
