Never heard of vino fresco or vino giovane? You're not alone. Most people haven't. Out of the thousands of grapes grown around the world, only a small percentage are palatable directly after fermentation and qualify for this designation ... and ... those few which do ... do so for only a few weeks. These enjoyable nectareous characteristics instantly start to mature into the desirable traits of an aged wine. Consequently, the appreciation, or even the awareness of the fresh style is limited to vineyard owners, family, staff and friends ... much to impractical to bottle or serve in restaurants ... until now!
