The Anxious Grape is a vino giovane, Italian for a young wine worthy of consuming immediately after fermentation. Descriptions of this short-lived-stage (measured in weeks) include: festive, easy-to-drink, spritzig, nectarous, tangy acidity, a dry-yet-juicy-finish, as well as a luscious aroma. Layers of complexity and evolvement are clearly absent.
